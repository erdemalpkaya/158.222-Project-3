# Project3


This project uses real-world GPS tracking data from buses and heavy vehicles on the northern motorway and the northern expressway routes.
This project is split into two parts. This first part will require you to perform data wrangling, integration, analysis and emphasise the predictive modelling. The second part will require you to perform cluster analysis.

-Can you predict what day of the week the buses and trucks are driving on, given their speed, north/south bound direction etc.? 
-Can you predict if the readings are for a bus or a truck?
-Given speed and time of the day, can you predict the direction?
